## Why this? :thinking:

I just wanted to try out the OpenAI API.
Nothing fancy though.

### How to use :raising_hand:

- Clone this repository.

- Install the dependencies with:

  ```bash
  npm install

  # or
  yarn

  # or
  pnpm install
  ```

- Go to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) website to get your API key.
- Populate your `.env` file with the API key (as suggested in the `.env.example` file).
- Have fun! :smile:
